## 1. The Manifesto: Death to the Pixel 💀
The world is drowning in "Digital Trash." Modern formats like `.jpg` and `.mp4` are locked into rigid pixel grids that blur when zoomed and eat massive amounts of data [cite: 2026-02-07]. 

**VectorVision** introduces a new universal standard that treats visual data as **Pure Geometry**. By replacing dots with mathematical paths, we achieve:
* **Infinite Fidelity**: Zoom 1000% with zero blur [cite: 2026-02-07].
* **85% Data Compression**: Turning 1GB of "trash" video into 150MB of clean geometry [cite: 2026-02-07].
* **CNC-Inspired Logic**: Using professional toolpathing algorithms (inspired by Vectric Aspire) to map the world [cite: 2025-10-15, 2025-11-29].

## 2. The New Global Standards: .svgc & .svgv

| Format | Replacement For | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`.svgc`** | `.jpg`, `.png`, `.bmp` | **Scalable Vector Geometric Camera/Image.** A single-frame capture of reality converted into coordinate-based paths [cite: 2026-02-07]. |
| **`.svgv`** | `.mp4`, `.mkv`, `.avi` | **Scalable Vector Global Video.** A high-speed stream of .svgc frames, storing only movement math rather than color blocks [cite: 2026-02-07]. |

## 3. Core Technologies
### 🔒 The "Anti-Trash" Fidelity Lock
Raster-to-Vector conversion usually loses fine detail. Our proprietary **Fidelity Lock** identifies "High-Frequency Interest Zones" (like facial features in K-Dramas) and pins coordinate precision to these areas while simplifying background noise [cite: 2025-11-21, 2026-02-07].

### ⚡ Parallel Scanline Vectorization (C++/NDK)
The engine runs on a custom C++ layer to ensure real-time performance on budget mobile hardware (2GB-4GB RAM) [cite: 2026-01-10, 2026-02-07].
* **SVGC Protocol**: Real-time camera-to-vector bridge [cite: 2026-02-07].
* **SVGV Protocol**: Delta-compression for geometric sequences [cite: 2026-02-07].

## 4. Why This Changes Everything
* **Data Equality**: High-quality content becomes accessible on slow 2G/3G networks in developing regions [cite: 2025-11-12, 2026-01-05, 2026-02-07].
* **Future-Proof**: A `.svgc` file captured today on a budget phone will render in native 16K resolution on the displays of the future [cite: 2026-02-07].
* **Searchable Vision**: Because the video is math, you can search for "objects" inside the file without AI processing—the geometry *is* the data [cite: 2026-02-07].

## 5. Development Log
* **Feb 2026**: Initiated GitHub Actions "Cloud Factory" for automated Android builds [cite: 2026-02-07].
* **Feb 2026**: Defined `.svgc` and `.svgv` file header protocols in C++ [cite: 2026-02-07].
* **Sept 2025**: Core theory established based on CNC machine operation and 2D design patterns [cite: 2025-09-15, 2025-10-15].

*This research is dedicated to the democratization of visual data. No more trash pixels—only pure geometry.*
Current video standards (H.264/H.265) are "pixel-heavy." On budget mobile devices common in developing regions:
1. **Storage/Data:** A single 1080p episode can exceed 1.5GB, making it inaccessible to users on limited data plans.
2. **Fidelity:** Digital zoom results in pixelation and "trashy" artifacts.
3. **Hardware:** Budget GPUs struggle to render high-bitrate AI-enhanced video without thermal throttling.



## 3. The SVGV Solution: Geometry over Imagery
Drawing inspiration from **CNC Toolpathing (G-code/Vectric Aspire)**, SVGV treats every frame as a collection of mathematical paths rather than a grid of colored dots.

### 3.1 The "Anti-Trash" Fidelity Lock
Unlike standard vectorizers that blur fine details, the **Anti-Trash Lock** identifies "High-Frequency Interest Zones" (eyes, lips, and textures). 
- It applies a **Bilateral Pre-Filter** to remove sensor grain.
- It locks the coordinate precision for facial features while simplifying background paths.

### 3.2 Parallel Scanline Vectorization
The engine utilizes a **Tile-Based Approach** to fit within the L1 cache of mobile GPUs (Mali/Adreno):
1. **Deconstruction:** The frame is split into 16x16 tiles.
2. **Path Extraction:** GPU cores execute parallel scanline tracing to identify contours.
3. **Quantization:** Math is performed in **Float16 (FP16)** to double speed on "trashy" hardware.



## 4. Hardware Acceleration Strategy
To run on a phone with 2GB-4GB of RAM, SVGV employs **Heterogeneous Computing**:
* **NPU:** Handles saliency detection and the Fidelity Lock.
* **GPU:** Handles Bézier path generation and rendering via Vulkan/OpenGL ES.
* **Delta-Compression:** Only moving coordinates are updated; static backgrounds are cached as persistent vector layers.



## 5. Potential Impact
* **Education:** Entire semester libraries can be stored in the space of a single movie.
* **Legacy:** Family videos and historical archives become "future-proof" for 8K/16K displays.
* **Hardware Equality:** A $100 phone captures and displays video with the clarity of a $1,000 device.

## 6. Conclusion & Future Work
SVGV is not just a codec; it is a democratization of visual data. Future research will focus on the **SVGV-NDK SDK**, allowing developers to integrate vector-video into existing apps without high CPU overhead.
